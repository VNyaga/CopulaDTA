## Resubmission
The previous version was on archived on 2022-09-17 as check problems were not corrected in time. The issue arose from dependence to a function in the `loo` package. I have updated the call to the function as well as other calls to functions in `ggplot2` which have also been changed.

## Test environment
* win-builder(devel)
* Rhub - Installation of `rstan` in linux times out

## R CMD check results
